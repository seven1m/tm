Some simple C++ data structures that work the way I want. Because I'm picky. :-)

NOTE: This repo isn't the "upstream" source.
[Look here](https://github.com/natalie-lang/natalie/tree/master/ext/tm) for
possibly more up-to-date code.


## Why should I use this?

If the C++ STL data structures work for you, then you probably shouldn't use this.
We use them for [Natalie](https://github.com/natalie-lang/natalie).
